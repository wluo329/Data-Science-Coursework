# Data-Science-Coursework

This repository goes over data science coursework that I took for the Spring 2022 iteration of Data 100 at the University of California, Berkeley.  This includes homeworks, labs, and projects that were completed over the course of the semester.

Students in Data 100 explore the data science lifecycle, including question formulation, data collection and cleaning, exploratory data analysis and visualization, statistical inference and prediction​, and decision-making.​ The class focuses on quantitative critical thinking​ and key principles and techniques needed to carry out this cycle. These include languages for transforming, querying and analyzing data; algorithms for machine learning methods including regression, classification and clustering; principles behind creating informative data visualizations; statistical concepts of measurement error and prediction; and techniques for scalable data processing.
